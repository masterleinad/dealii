<h3> Possible extensions </h3>

Currently, there is no preconditioner used at all. This is mainly since 
constructing an efficient matrix-free preconditioner is non-trivial.
However, simple choices just requiring the diagonal of the corresponding matrix
are good candidates. In particular, one good extend the tutorial to use multigird 
with Chebyshev smoothers similar to step-37.

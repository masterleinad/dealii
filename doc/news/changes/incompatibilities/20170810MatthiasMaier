Removed: Some old functionality has been removed from LogStream:
<ul>
  <li>The reproducible test functionality has been removed.
    This includes <code>test_mode()</code>, <code>threshold_double()</code>,
    and <code>threshold_float()</code>. Use numdiff, or other tools that can
    do output comparison with small numerical differences instead.</li>
  <li>The <code>log_cerr()</code> function has been removed.
  <li>The timing mechanism has been removed. This includes
    <code>timestamp()</code>, <code>log_execution_time()</code> and
    <code>log_time_differences()</code>. Use the Timer, TimerOutput and
    TimerOutput::Scope classes instead.</li>
  <li>LogStream now defaults to write to std::cout instead of
    std::cerr</li>
</ul>

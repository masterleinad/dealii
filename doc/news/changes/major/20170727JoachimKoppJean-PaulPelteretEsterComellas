New: The eigenvectors of a rank-2 symmetric tensor can now be computed using one
of three approaches through the eigenvectors() function. The three algorithms
that have been implemented are:
1. The QL algorithm with implicit shifting.
2. A hybrid algorithm that preferentially uses an analytical algorithm
and falls back to the QL algorithm if the calculations are deemed
inaccurate.
3. The Jacobi algorithm.

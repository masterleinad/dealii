Changed: ParameterHandler::print_parameters() was at times looking at
individual bits instead of just the declared values
of ParameterHandler::OutputStyle. This presumably allowed for calling that
function with a combination of the OutputStyle flags, for reasons that no
longer seem particularly relevant nor obvious.

This possibility has now been removed from the current implementation of
the function, but is for the moment retained for the (deprecated) function
ParameterHandler::print_parameters_section().

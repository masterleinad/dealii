Improved: The FEInterfaceValues values public interface has been extended
further to support hp-FEM. Functions have been added to report if the class has
been initialized with hp support, and to get the underlying
hp::MappingCollection, hp::FECollection and hp::QCollection. The various
FEInterfaceValues::reinit() methods now accept indices to indicate which
quadrature rule, mapping (and, in some cases, finite elements) should be used to
compute values across the interface.
